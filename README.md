# SDL2 CMake Template

Quick Template project to setup a CMake SDL2 Application.

## Setup

- Fork
- Edit `CMakeLists.txt` and change `SDL2_PATH` on line 19, to the path where you have SDL2 libraries. ( WINDOWS )
- Enjoy.

When building, `CMake` will copy `SDL2.dll` to the output directory. Default is `bin\debug`.
